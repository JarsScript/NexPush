Introducing NexPush.js 

This script, made by JarsScript, with assistance from Stef ( discord: @stef_dp ), allows you to conveniently upload your project directly from the editor to the server using the SFTP connection. You can easily check and input your username and port data for the server. If your project is hosted on GitHub, NexPush.js offers you the choice to push it there as well! It's a 2x1 deal. A lot of encouragement and love was poured into this mini project, all for Nexcord! 

## Usage

1. **Add Script to Your Project:**
   - Copy the NexPush.js script file into the root of your main project directory.

2. **Configure SFTP Connection:**
   - Make sure to fill in your server's username and port data when prompted.

3. **Optional: GitHub Push:**
   - If your project is on GitHub, you can choose to push it to GitHub as well when prompted.

4. **Run the Script:**
   - Execute the script, and it will handle the upload process for you.

## Notes

- Ensure that the NexPush.js script is placed at the root of your main project directory.
- This script simplifies the process of uploading your project to the server via SFTP and optionally to GitHub.
